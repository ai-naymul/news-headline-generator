This the News Headline Generator Application, a shot application where it get some news from api and generate a fake news headline using LLM and compare it to it. This is just a fun project.

Here is the subtasks:

1. Set Up the Environment:
    - Install necessary Python libraries (transformers, torch, requests, etc.).
    - Set up the API key for any pre-trained language model you plan to use (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5).

2. Fetch Current News Headlines:
    - Use a news API (e.g., NewsAPI, Bing News Search API) to fetch current news headlines.
    - Parse and store these headlines for use in the project.

3. Prepare the Language Model:
    - Load the pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-3.5 from OpenAI, or a Hugging Face model).
    - Ensure the model is ready to generate text based on given prompts.

4. Generate Fake News Headlines:
    - Create a function to generate fake news headlines using the language model.
    - Input real news headlines or keywords as prompts to the language model.
    - Store the generated fake headlines.

5. Compare Real and Fake Headlines:
    - Display the real and generated fake headlines side by side.
    - Optionally, add a feature to highlight differences or similarities between them.

6. Build a Simple User Interface:
    - Create a basic web interface using a framework like Flask or Streamlit.
    - Provide an input field for users to fetch new headlines and generate fake ones.
    - Display the results in a user-friendly format.
